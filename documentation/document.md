### Problem Definition

Today, the average consumer of media content is very susceptible to unknown bias in the sources that they use. Because all media sources 
most likely have some bias, in order for consumers to be most informed, they need a reliable way to measure bias and account for it in
their research/consumtion of media information. If users could know what bias and relevant information about the statistical history for
a particular news establishment, it would increase consumer ability to gather and trust information from media. 
Similarly, currently, it is very difficult to document and discuss media bias in a way that is provable and measureable. There needs to be
a standard to use, or a metric to measure by, in order to determine how much of a report is motivated by bias and how much seems to be motivated purely by facts.

### Problem Solution

We propose the following software solution:

1. Using published text from media sources, and computer analysis, we propse a software system that uses these published works and 
the resulting data to provide means to measure how that media source reports on certain topics. This would fix both issues above.
For the first problem, having this data will allow users to have an objective source analyze the data and output information that they can
then use to judge the media source. All the data will be relative to the source, and all source data should be analyzed in the same 
way to prevent harming the integrity of the data. Having a metric that is gathered in the same way for all sources allows consumers to
compare data for one source, to the same measurement for a different source, allowing them to make better judgements about bias regarding 
sources they use. 
The problem of documenting media bias also is solved, as this data could be used as evidence for or against these sources to use as
a basis for research and reports, which is an objective metric, rather than the opinions of the reporting person or eye witness
interview.
